### Introduction
The Face Detection project utilizes computer vision to detect human faces within images. It is designed to be robust and efficient, capable of detecting faces under various conditions and orientations.

### Architecture and Techniques
The project employs the following architecture and techniques:
- **MobileNet Architecture**: Specifically chosen for its lightweight and efficient characteristics, making it suitable for real-time face detection on mobile and embedded devices.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Utilized within the MobileNet architecture for feature extraction and detection.
- **Image Processing**: Techniques such as image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to preprocess images for better detection accuracy.
- **Face Detection Algorithms**: Implementation of algorithms like Haar Cascades or more advanced deep learning models for face detection.

### Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Madhusudhana7259/Face-Detection.git
    cd Face-Detection
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage
After setting up the environment, you can use the main script to detect faces in images:
```bash
python detect_faces.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
```
Replace `path/to/your/image.jpg` with the path to the image you want to analyze for face detection.

### Operations on Images
The project includes various operations on images to enhance face detection accuracy:
- **Preprocessing**: Image resizing, normalization, and enhancement.
- **Augmentation**: Data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of training data.
- **Post-processing**: Filtering and refining detected faces for better presentation.
