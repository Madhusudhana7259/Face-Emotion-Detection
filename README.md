### Introduction
The Real-time Emotion Detection from Faces project aims to detect and recognize emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more from live camera feeds. It integrates face detection with emotion recognition, providing instantaneous feedback on the emotional state of individuals in front of the camera.

### Architecture and Techniques
The project utilizes the following architecture and techniques:
- **MobileNet Architecture**: Chosen for its lightweight and efficient characteristics, ideal for real-time face detection and emotion recognition on mobile and embedded devices.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Embedded within the MobileNet architecture for face detection and feature extraction.
- **Emotion Recognition**: Utilizes deep learning models trained on datasets to classify facial expressions into predefined emotions.
- **Real-time Processing**: Processes camera frames in real-time to detect faces and analyze facial expressions.

### Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Madhusudhana7259/Face-Detection.git
    cd Face-Detection
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage
After setting up the environment, you can use the main script to detect faces and analyze emotions in real-time:
```bash
python detect_emotions.py
```
Ensure your camera is connected and positioned to capture faces. The script will display live feedback on detected emotions.

### Operations on Images
The project includes various operations on images to enhance emotion detection accuracy:
- **Preprocessing**: Image resizing, normalization, and enhancement for better emotion recognition.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides instantaneous feedback on detected emotions from live camera feeds.
